# KG-LLM: Knowledge Graph Large Language Model for Link Prediction

![](KG.png?raw=true)

## Abstract:
The task of multi-hop link prediction within knowledge graphs (KGs) stands as a challenge in the field of knowledge graph analysis, a challenge increasingly resolvable due to advancements in natural language processing (NLP) and KG embedding techniques. This paper introduces a novel methodology, the Knowledge Graph Large Language Model Framework (KG-LLM), which leverages pivotal NLP paradigms. We use our method to convert structured knowledge graph data into natural language, and then use these natural language prompts to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) to enhance multi-hop link prediction in KGs. By converting the KG to natural language prompts, our framework is designed to discern and learn the latent representations of entities and their interrelations. To show the efficacy of the KG-LLM Framework, we fine-tune three leading LLMs within this framework, using both in-context learning (ICL) and without ICL techniques for a thorough evaluation. Further, we explore the framework's potential to provide LLMs with zero-shot capabilities for handling previously unseen prompts. Our experimental findings discover that the performance of our approach can significantly boost the models' generalization capacity, thereby ensuring more precise predictions in unfamiliar scenarios.

## Dataset:
We conduct experiments over *two* real-world datasets, WN18RR and NELL-995, which are constructed and released by the [OpenKE library](https://github.com/thunlp/OpenKE/tree/OpenKE-PyTorch).
| Dataset  | #Entities | #Triples  | #Relations  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| -----:|
| [WN18RR](https://github.com/thunlp/OpenKE/tree/OpenKE-PyTorch/benchmarks/WN18RR)      | 40,943 | 86,835 | 11 |
| [NELL-995](https://github.com/thunlp/OpenKE/tree/OpenKE-PyTorch/benchmarks/NELL-995)      | 75,492      |   149,678 |   200 |

## Preprocessing

1. Clone Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```python
   git clone
   ```

3. Download Data: Download the dataset from the previously mentioned library.

4. Place Files: Put the downloaded dataset in the same directory as the `KGLLM_preprocess.py` script.

5. Run Script: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the script and files, and run the following command:
   ```python
   python KGLLM_preprocess.py
   ```
5. Check Output: After running the script, you should find some new CSV files containing the preprocessed training data and testing data in the same directory.

## Finetune
Three distinct LLMs are utilized: Flan-T5-Large, LlaMa2-7B, and Gemma-7B.

| Model  | #Parameter | #Maximum Token  | #Technique  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| -----:|
| [Flan-T5-Large](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-large)  | 783M | 512 | Global Fine-tune |
| [LLaMa2-7B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf)      | 7B      |   4096 |   4bit-Lora |
| [Gemma-7B](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-7b)      | 7B      |   4096 |   4bit-Lora |


1. Download File

  > Download the corresponding finetune file and put it in the same folder as the csv file generated by preprocess.

2. Modify Parameters

  > Open the finetune file and modify the two parameters in the main function:

  > input_file: Modify it to point to the path of the train.csv file generated by preprocessing.

  > output_dir: Modify it to the directory path where you want to save the trained model.

  > You can also modify some hyperparameters if you wish.

  Example code:
  ```python
     main(input_file="/content/train.csv", output_dir="final_checkpoint")
  ```
3. Run the File

  > Run the finetune file in the command line and wait for the model training to complete.

  Example code:
  ```python
     python train_llama.py
  ```

4. Model Training Completed

  > After training, the trained model checkpoint files will be generated in the specified output_dir directory.

## Test

1. Modify Test File
   
  Open the test script file (test_link_icl.py) and locate the following parameters:

  test_file: Modify this parameter to specify the path to the test file (modified_test.csv).

  model: Modify this parameter to specify the path to the trained model checkpoint directory.

2. Run the Test Script
   
  Run the test script (test.py) in the command line and wait for the model testing to complete.
  
  Example command:
  ```python
     python test_link_icl.py
  ```

3. View Accuracy
  After testing, the script will output the accuracy of the model on the test dataset.
  
  Example output:
  ```python
     Accuracy: 0.95
     F1: 0.93
  ```
